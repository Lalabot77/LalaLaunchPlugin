# Branching Notes

The live telemetry snapshot work (LaunchSummaryExpander, FuelCalcs bindings, and telemetry plumbing)
now lives directly on the local `main` branch in this checkout (the old `work`/`live-telemetry-snapshot`
references are historical). Use `main` for any follow-up fixes or reviews so everything stays in one
place and avoids future branch conflicts.
